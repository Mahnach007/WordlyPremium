# WordlyPremium

**WordlyPremium** is an AI-powered vocabulary learning application designed to streamline the process of acquiring new words. By leveraging artificial intelligence, WordlyPremium automatically generates flashcards, allowing users to focus more on learning and less on manual data entry.

## 🚀 Features

* **AI Integration**: Employs the DeepSeek model to analyze text and generate relevant vocabulary flashcards.
* **SwiftUI Interface**: Offers a responsive and modern user interface tailored for iOS devices.

* **Customizable Learning Packs**: Allows users to input their own text sources for personalized study materials.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **SwiftUI**: For building the user interface.
* **SwiftData**: To manage and persist user data locally.
